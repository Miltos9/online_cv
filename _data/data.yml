            Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language,
            which means it can be used in different spheres of human activity 
            (unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are mainly used in web development).
            Python can be used in software developing, data science, back-end development, etc.
            In this course, you will meet with the main aspects of Python and by the end of this 
            course, you will be able to write your functions!
